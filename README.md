# Your Project's Name

Hi! my name is Jai, and I am excited to share my website with you all. The website that I have created is a fast food restuarant. The restruarant name is called "Jai's Burger". In today's fast paced society, everyone is very busy with their own things and don't really have the time to go out and order food. Hence, they turn to online delivery to order their favourite food and enjoy it at the comfort of their home. Furthermore, our society is digitally revolutionising as everybody is moving towards digital technology hence in order to adapt to this revolution, I have decided to create a website that provides delivery of authentic chicken burgers inspired from our locals in Singapore at a much more affordable price online.

## Design Process

My website is suitable for all ages but it mainly targets the younger generation who have a craving over fast foods. Nowadays burgers and french fries are a part of their lifes. Furthermore, due to Covid the whole world shifted its traditional way of ordering food at the restaurant with family members and friends to ordering online at the comfort of their home. Hence, this website would help youths purchase the craving food that they desire the most at ease by simply ordering online. Being a youth myself, I feel that such website would be very helpful as I don't have to worry about buying food outside when I am piled up with work. Youths could also just order the products they want anytime they want from any where with their smartphones. From the wireframe, you would notice that the website is very user friendly as it has a simple design with feature rich components.


## Features

- In the navigation bar you can click the different parts which will bring you to the different parts of my project or you can scroll down to the different parts of   the website manually.

- There is an order button at the homepage when you click the order button you will be brought to the order page where you can place your order 

- When you scroll down to the menu page there is a heart icon for you to click so when you order again in the future you can just view the food that you saved in     your favourites by clicking the heart icon in the navigation bar

### Features Left to Implement 

- Another feature idea
- I would like to add a loading page so that when my users click the order button there is a waiting room for them to wait before their order is successfully         confirmed

- I would like to add the function where my users can view their cart to see what they have bought overall and make changes before paying. 

- I would like to add a count in my cart to show the users how many items they have in their cart

## Technologies Used

- [HTML]    - Used HTML as the main base for my website

- [CSS]   - Used CSS to style my website    

## Testing

From my testing, I have discovered that the website is responsive at 400px width which gives the user the mobile version when they use their phone to order
