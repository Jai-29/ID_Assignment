# Your Project's Name

Hi! my name is Jai, and I am excited to share my website with you all. The website that I have created is a fast food restuarant. The restruarant name is called "Jai's Burger". In today's fast paced society, everyone is very busy with their own things and don't really have the time to go out and order food. Hence, they turn to online delivery to order their favourite food and enjoy it at the comfort of their home. Furthermore, our society is digitally revolutionising as everybody is moving towards digital technology hence in order to adapt to this revolution, I have decided to create a website that provides delivery of authentic chicken burgers inspired from our locals in Singapore at a much more affordable price online.

## Design Process

This website is applicable to every age group but is mainly targeted to the younger generation to cater their dietery requirements. I feel that its very important to cultivate good eating habits from a young age. This website features products ranging from organic vegetables and fruits to fresh meat varieties. The younger generations are more health consicous than the older  generation. This can be seen through the increase in use of gyms among the youths and also youths being more cautious in their food intake. But youths do suffer from making wise choices on food sometimes as they do priorities convenience over healthy options. This website would help youths purchase healthy nutritious food products at ease by simply ordering online. Bein a youth myself I feel that such website would be very helpful as I dont have to worry about purchasing grocoeries that are filled with chemiclas or being gentically modified. Youths could also just order the products they want antime they want from any where with their smartphones. From the wireframe, you would notice that the website is very user friendly as it has a simple design with feature rich components.

## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
The website has a login page at the top right hand corner to login to their account.This allows users to login to their account to view special membership offers.
The website also has a shopping cart icon which help to show users what are the products that they have added into their shopping list and the total price of their purchase. Users can also search for the products they want to buy with the search icon. Users can view the different products and product categories too. They can also input the quantity of the products they want to buy right under the product itself. There are even contact details at the footer portion of the website. Users can just click on the email id or the number which would then take them to the respective pages to contact the company.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea
I would like to add more pages in the future so that i could add more products to the website. With more pages, I could organise my products more easliy and have a wider variety to the choices or organic products. I would like also like to do validation too. I would also like to add an countdown page for any special sales so that the users know when to shop to get the best rates.
